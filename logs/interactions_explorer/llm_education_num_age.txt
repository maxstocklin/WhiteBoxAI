1. The interaction effect between Education Num and Age starts off slightly positive for individuals with no education numbers, but then becomes consistently negative as Education Num increases. This indicates that the relationship between Age and the model's predictions is generally inverse (i.e., older individuals are associated with lower predictions), but this relationship becomes stronger as Education Num increases.

2. The interaction effect does not appear to exhibit any clear threshold or non-linear effects. Instead, it follows a monotonic decreasing trend, with the interaction strength becoming more negative as Education Num increases.

3. The consistent negative interaction effect between Education Num and Age suggests that older individuals with lower levels of education are likely to have lower model predictions than younger individuals with higher levels of education. This finding could be important for understanding potential disparities in model outcomes based on both Age and Education Num. However, it's essential to consider other features and potential confounding variables when interpreting these results, as correlation does not imply causation. Additionally, it's crucial to ensure that the model's predictions are fair, unbiased, and accurate for all subgroups defined by Age and Education Num.
