1. Based on the provided table, it appears that the interaction effect between Hours Per Week and Relationship is generally small and varies between positive and negative values. However, when Hours Per Week is high (0.1188), the interaction effect is significantly larger and positive, indicating a stronger interaction.
2. The interaction effect does not show any clear threshold or non-linear effects based on the given data. The interaction strength remains relatively stable across the different bins of Hours Per Week, except for the highest bin where it increases substantially.
3. This means that the relationship between Hours Per Week and the target variable is not constant but depends on the specific relationship status. The larger positive interaction effect for high Hours Per Week suggests that the relationship status may have a stronger influence on the target variable when people work longer hours. Transparency-wise, understanding this interaction effect can help in identifying potential causes of the observed relationship and improve the overall model interpretation.
