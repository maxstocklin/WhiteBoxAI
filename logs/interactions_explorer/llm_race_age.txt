1. The interaction effect between Race and Age appears to be relatively small and inconsistent across all bins of Race, with both positive and negative values. However, the interaction effect is more pronounced in some bins compared to others, such as the bin with an interaction strength of 0.0177.
2. There does not seem to be a clear threshold or non-linear effect based on the given interaction values. The interaction effect appears to be continuous across different bins of Race.
3. The interaction effect between Race and Age suggests that the relationship between these two features may be complex and may influence each other's impact on the model's predictions. Understanding these interaction effects is crucial for interpreting model behavior and ensuring fairness and transparency in model predictions. It is essential to consider these findings when making decisions based on the model's outputs, particularly in contexts where Race and Age are sensitive features.
