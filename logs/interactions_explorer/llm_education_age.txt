1. The interaction effect between Education and Age starts off negative with a small magnitude for low Education levels, but then becomes positive as Education increases. This means that the relationship between Age and the model's predictions is inverse for lower Education levels, but becomes direct for higher Education levels.

2. There doesn't appear to be any clear threshold or non-linear effects based on the given interaction strengths. However, it's important to note that these interaction effects are only an average within each Education bin, and the actual interaction effect may vary more smoothly across the entire range of Education and Age values.

3. This interaction pattern suggests that the effect of Age on the model's predictions may depend on an individual's level of Education. Specifically, the relationship between Age and the model's predictions may be inverse for those with lower levels of Education, but direct for those with higher levels of Education. This can help inform interpretations of model predictions, but it also highlights the importance of considering both Education and Age as important factors in understanding the model's behavior.
