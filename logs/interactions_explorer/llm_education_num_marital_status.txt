1. The interaction effect between Education Num and Marital Status is consistently negative, indicating that the effect of Marital Status on the model's predictions is stronger for individuals with lower Education Num. However, the magnitude of the interaction effect increases as Education Num increases, suggesting that the impact of Marital Status becomes more pronounced for individuals with higher levels of education.

2. There doesn't seem to be a clear threshold or non-linear effect based on the information provided. The interaction effect remains negative throughout all bins of Education Num.

3. The interaction effect between Education Num and Marital Status highlights the importance of considering feature interactions in model analysis. Understanding how these two factors influence each other can provide valuable insights into the underlying data and help improve model performance and transparency. In this case, the finding suggests that Marital Status may have a greater impact on model predictions for individuals with higher levels of education.
