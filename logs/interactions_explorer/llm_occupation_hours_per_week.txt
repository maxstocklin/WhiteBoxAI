1. The interaction effect between Occupation and Hours Per Week is generally negative, indicating that as hours worked per week increase, the impact on the model's prediction becomes less favorable for individuals in a given occupation group. However, there are some variations in the interaction strength within different occupation groups. For instance, the interaction is more negative for individuals in the group with an interaction strength of -0.0079, compared to those in the group with an interaction strength of 0.0197.

2. There doesn't appear to be a clear threshold or non-linear effect based on the given interaction values. However, further analysis would be needed to confirm this, as the interaction effect may not be fully captured by the provided data.

3. The interaction effect between Occupation and Hours Per Week sheds light on the complex relationship between these two features and the model's predictions. Understanding these interactions can help us identify potential patterns or trends in the data that might be important for model interpretation and improvement. For example, it could indicate that certain occupations are more susceptible to the negative impact of working long hours, or that the relationship between hours worked and model predictions varies between different occupation groups. Overall, interpreting interaction effects can help improve model transparency and aid in making more informed decisions based on the model's predictions.
