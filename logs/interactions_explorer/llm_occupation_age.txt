1. The interaction effect between Age and Occupation is generally positive, with some variability in magnitude. However, there doesn't seem to be a clear pattern in how the interaction strength changes with different occupations. For some occupations, the interaction effect is relatively small (around 0.006 and -0.001), while for others it is larger and positive (around 0.043 and 0.046).
2. There doesn't appear to be any threshold or non-linear effects based on the given data. The interaction effect remains consistently positive for all occupations, without any sudden drops or changes at specific age ranges.
3. These findings suggest that the relationship between Age and the target variable is influenced by Occupation, but the nature of this influence varies across different occupations. The model's predictions are likely to depend on both Age and Occupation, making the interaction effect an important factor to consider for model transparency and interpretation.
