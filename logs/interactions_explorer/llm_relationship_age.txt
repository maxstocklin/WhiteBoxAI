Based on the provided table, there seems to be a small positive interaction effect between Age and the model's predictions when the Relationship bin is N/A. However, there are also instances with negative interaction effects, although they are relatively small in magnitude.

There doesn't appear to be any clear threshold or non-linear effects in the table, as the interaction strength generally stays within a narrow range across all Relationship bins.

This means that both Age and Relationship contribute independently to the model's predictions, with a slight interaction effect. However, the absence of clear threshold or non-linear effects suggests that the model's behavior may be relatively straightforward, making it easier to interpret and trust.
