1. The interaction effect between Relationship and Education Num is generally small, with most values being negative, suggesting a weak negative relationship between the two features. However, there are also some positive interaction effects, indicating that in certain situations, a stronger Education Num can lead to a slightly positive effect on the model's predictions, even for individuals with no identified Relationship status.
2. There does not appear to be a clear threshold or non-linear effect based on the provided data. The interaction effect remains relatively consistent across the different bins of Relationship, with only small variations in magnitude.
3. The lack of significant threshold or non-linear effects suggests that the relationship between Relationship and Education Num is stable and consistent, which can help improve model interpretability and transparency. However, it's essential to consider the overall context and potential confounding variables when interpreting these results. Additionally, it may be beneficial to explore the interaction effects in more detail using visualization techniques or further data analysis to ensure a comprehensive understanding of the relationship between these two features.
