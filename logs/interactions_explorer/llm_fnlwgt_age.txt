1. The interaction effect between Fnlwgt and Age is mostly insignificant or slightly positive when Fnlwgt is not a specific value. However, there is a notable negative interaction effect when Fnlwgt is a specific value, which is -0.0546.

2. Based on the provided data, there doesn't seem to be a clear threshold or non-linear effect regarding Age and Fnlwgt interaction. The interaction effect is relatively consistent across the different bins of Fnlwgt.

3. The interaction effect between Fnlwgt and Age doesn't show any significant threshold or non-linear patterns. However, the presence of a notable negative interaction effect when Fnlwgt is a specific value warrants further investigation to understand the underlying relationship and potential implications for the model's predictions. This finding adds to the model's transparency by highlighting the importance of considering the specific value of Fnlwgt when interpreting the interaction effect with Age.
