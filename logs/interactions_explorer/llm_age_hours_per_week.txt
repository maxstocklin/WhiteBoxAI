1. The interaction effect between Age and Hours Per Week is generally negative, indicating that the relationship between the two features is inverse. However, the magnitude of the interaction effect varies across different age groups. For instance, the interaction effect is more pronounced when Age is in the lower range, with a stronger negative interaction observed for the youngest age group. As Age increases, the interaction effect becomes less negative and eventually approaches zero, suggesting a weaker interaction effect for older age groups.

2. There does not appear to be a clear threshold or non-linear effect based on the provided data. The interaction effect steadily decreases as Age increases, with no significant changes in trend observed.

3. The interaction between Age and Hours Per Week plays a role in shaping the model's predictions, as it indicates that the effect of Hours Per Week on the target variable is modified by an individual's Age. Understanding this interaction can provide valuable insights into how different age groups respond to changes in Hours Per Week. However, it is essential to keep in mind that the provided analysis is based on an average interaction effect across bins of Age, and individual data points may exhibit different patterns. Therefore, further investigation and exploration of the data are necessary for a complete understanding of the model's behavior.
