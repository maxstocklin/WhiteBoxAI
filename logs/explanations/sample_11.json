The top 3 most influential features that pushed the prediction toward class 0 are:\n   - Marital Status: Divorced, with a SHAP value of -0.749. Divorced individuals were associated with a higher probability of belonging to class 0.\n   - Occupation: Handlers-cleaners, with a SHAP value of -0.751. Individuals in this occupation were also more likely to be classified as belonging to class 0.\n   - Education: HS-grad, with a SHAP value of 0.012.

Summary:\n   - The model is highly confident that sample #11 belongs to class 0.\n   - The most influential features pushing the prediction toward class 0 are having a divorced marital status, working as a handler-cleaner, and having only a high school diploma.\n4. Assessment: The prediction seems reasonable based on the identified influential features. Divorced individuals and individuals in the handler-cleaner occupation, along with having only a high school diploma, have been associated with a higher probability of belonging to class 0."
