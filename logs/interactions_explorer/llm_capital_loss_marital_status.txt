1. The interaction effect between Capital Loss and Marital Status is generally positive, indicating that the relationship between these two features strengthens as Capital Loss increases. However, the magnitude of the interaction effect varies significantly across different bins of Capital Loss. For small values of Capital Loss, the interaction effect is relatively small, whereas for larger values of Capital Loss, the interaction effect becomes more pronounced.
2. Based on the data provided, there doesn't seem to be any clear threshold or non-linear effects. The interaction effect increases steadily as Capital Loss grows larger.
3. These findings suggest that the relationship between Capital Loss and Marital Status is more complex than a simple additive effect. The interaction effect indicates that Marital Status may influence the impact of Capital Loss on the model's predictions. This adds to the model's complexity and makes it more challenging to interpret. Therefore, it's essential to maintain transparency by visualizing and understanding these interaction effects to accurately interpret the model's predictions.
