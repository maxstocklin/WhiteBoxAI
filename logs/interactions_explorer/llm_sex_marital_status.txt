Based on the provided data, there is a consistent negative interaction effect between Sex and Marital Status, with an average interaction strength ranging from -0.0179 to -0.1528 when Sex is not a categorical variable. This suggests that the negative effect of Marital Status on the model's predictions is more pronounced for individuals identified as 'Sex' (presumably males, since 'Sex' is listed as N/A).

No clear threshold or non-linear effects are evident from the data, as the interaction strength remains consistently negative across all bins of Sex.

The consistent negative interaction effect between Sex and Marital Status indicates that, in general, the negative effect of Marital Status on the model's predictions is more pronounced for males. This finding is essential for model transparency, as it highlights a potential demographic factor that influences model predictions. However, it is important to consider other potential confounding factors and ensure that these results are not simply a result of confounding. Additionally, further exploration, such as analyzing the distribution of Marital Status within each Sex category, could provide more insight into the nature of this interaction.
