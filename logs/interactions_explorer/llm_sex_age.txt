Based on the provided table, there doesn't seem to be a clear pattern in how the interaction effect between **Sex** and **Age** changes depending on the value of **Sex**. All interaction values are negative, indicating a potential negative interaction between **Sex** and **Age**. However, the magnitude of the interaction effect varies across different bins of **Sex**.

There doesn't appear to be any clear threshold or non-linear effects based on the given information. The interaction effect remains relatively consistent across all **Sex** bins.

The lack of clear threshold or non-linear effects suggests that the model's predictions are likely to be relatively stable and predictable, with the interaction effect between **Sex** and **Age** being relatively consistent across different age groups. However, it's important to keep in mind that the absence of threshold or non-linear effects in this analysis doesn't necessarily mean that they don't exist in the underlying data. Further analysis, such as visualizing the interaction effect using a 3D plot or interaction plots, may help identify any potential threshold or non-linear effects that were not apparent from the table alone.
